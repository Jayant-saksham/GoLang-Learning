    "In this beginner-level project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We define a `Book` struct to represent a book with `ID`, `Title`, and `Author` fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We create a slice `books` to store a list of books (in memory, not using a database).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We define three routes:\n",
    "   - `/books`: List all books.\n",
    "   - `/books/:id`: Get a book by its ID (e.g., `/books/1` to get the book with ID 1).\n",
    "   - `/books`: Add a new book with a POST request.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We use middleware to log incoming requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To run this project:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a directory for your project (e.g., `book-api`) and create a `main.go` file inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Copy the code from the `main.go` snippet above into your `main.go` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command to start the server:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   go run main.go\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You can use tools like `curl` or Postman to interact with the API. Here are some example requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - List all books: `curl http://localhost:8080/books`\n",
    "   - Get a book by ID: `curl http://localhost:8080/books/1`\n",
    "   - Add a new book (POST request): `curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"title\": \"Sample Book\", \"author\": \"Sample Author\"}' http://localhost:8080/books`\n",
    "\n",
